Probabilistic Robotics - Algorithms Implementations

This repository is intended to be used in Probabilistic Robotics course in PPGI-UFES.
The packages presented here are still under construction and they are not supposed to be used in a production environment.
If some package became mature enough then it will be transfered to a separate project.
